# Transformation Techniques in Data Preprocessing
This project demonstrates common feature transformation techniques used in data preprocessing for machine learning. It includes applications such as:

Log transformation for reducing skewness

Box-Cox and Yeo-Johnson transformations for handling non-normal distributions

Visual comparisons

These techniques help improve model performance by making data more suitable for learning algorithms.
